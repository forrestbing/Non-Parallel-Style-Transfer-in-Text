# A Paper List for Style Transfer in Text
This is a paper list for style transfer in text. I will report some important papers, and I think these papers will helps research for style transfer task. It also contains related papers of controlled text generation. 

The base papers forked from https://github.com/fuzhenxin/Style-Transfer-in-Text
